# fizzbuzz
# Write a method that takes two arguments: the first is the starting number, and the second is the ending number. Print out all numbers between the two numbers, except if a number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz", if a number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz", and finally if a number is divisible by 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

# Example:

# Copy Code
# fizzbuzz(1, 15) # -> 1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz


def fizzbuzz(start, end):
    for i in range(start, end + 1):
        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
            print("FizzBuzz")
        elif i % 5 == 0:
            print("Buzz")
        elif i % 3 == 0:
            print("Fizz")
        else:
            print(i)


fizzbuzz(1, 15)
