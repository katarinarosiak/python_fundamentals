# Exclusive Or
# The || operator returns a truthy value if either or both of its operands are truthy, a falsey value if both operands are falsey. The && operator returns a truthy value if both of its operands are truthy, and a falsey value if either operand is falsey. This works great until you need only one of two conditions to be truthy, the so-called exclusive or.

# In this exercise, you will write a function named xor that takes two arguments, and returns true if exactly one of its arguments is truthy, false otherwise. Note that we are looking for a boolean result instead of a truthy/falsy value as returned by || and &&.

# Examples:

# Copy Code
# xor?(5.even?, 4.even?) == true
# xor?(5.odd?, 4.odd?) == true
# xor?(5.odd?, 4.even?) == false
# xor?(5.even?, 4.odd?) == false


def xor(val1, val2):
    if (val1 and not val2) or (not val1 and val2):
        return True
    else:
        return False


print(xor(True, True))
