# All Substrings
# Write a method that returns a list of all substrings of a string. The returned list should be ordered by where in the string the substring begins. This means that all substrings that start at position 0 should come first, then all substrings that start at position 1, and so on. Since multiple substrings will occur at each position, the substrings at a given position should be returned in order from shortest to longest.

# You may (and should) use the leading_substrings method you wrote in the previous exercise:

# Examples:

# Copy Code
# substrings('abcde') == [
#   'a', 'ab', 'abc', 'abcd', 'abcde',
#   'b', 'bc', 'bcd', 'bcde',
#   'c', 'cd', 'cde',
#   'd', 'de',
#   'e'
# ]


def substrings(char_sequence):
    all_substr = [
        char_sequence[i:j]
        for i in range(len(char_sequence))
        for j in range(i + 1, len(char_sequence) + 1)
    ]
    return all_substr


print(substrings("abcde"))
